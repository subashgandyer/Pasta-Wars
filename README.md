This repo contains code, doc of Deep Learning Project that I did where I tried to classify different kinds of Pastas.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a State-of-the-art classification system that will identify the different kinds of Pastas.

## Description

Images of different kinds of Pastas like Penne and Spaghetti are collected using Google Image Scrapers. A pre-trained network like Resnet34 is used to fine-tune the classifier with these images. Images are cleaned, pre-processed and fed to the network. Deep learning model is built with the best features for discriminating penne and spaghetti images. The built model is optimized for generalization and accuracy. The optimized model is then validated and evaluated against the test set.

## Input & Output

Input : Penne and Spaghetti images

Output: Class label of Penne or Spaghetti
